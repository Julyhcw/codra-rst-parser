Founded in 1899 by a group of Swiss, English and Catalan footballers led by Joan Gamper, the club has become a symbol of Catalan culture and Catalanism, hence the motto "Més que un club" (More than a club). 

Unlike many other football clubs, the supporters own and operate Barcelona. 

It is the world's second-richest football club in terms of revenue, with an annual turnover of $613 million and the third most valuable, worth $2.6 billion. The official Barcelona anthem is the "Cant del Barça", written by Jaume Picas and Josep Maria Espinàs.
